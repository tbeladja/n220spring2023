// Declare variables for x and y position of the circle, as well as xSpeed and ySpeed

// In the setup function, create canvas with width of 800 and height of 600

//In the draw function:

  // Clear background
  // Draw circle at current x and y position
  // Update x and y position by adding corresponding speed variables
  // Check if x position is at or past the width of the canvas (800) or if it is at or past 0
  // If either of these conditions are met, multiply xSpeed by -1 to change direction of movement
  // Check if y position is at or past the height of the canvas (600) or if it is at or past 0
  // If either of these conditions are met, multiply ySpeed by -1 to change direction of movement
