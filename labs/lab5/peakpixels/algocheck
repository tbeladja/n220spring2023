Start by creating a square-shaped box on the web page with green color using HTML and CSS.
In JavaScript, make a variable to keep track of the height and width of the box.
Then, when someone clicks on the box, make the box grow in size by 10% each time it's clicked. To do this, multiply the height and width of the box by 1.1.
Lastly, change the height and width of the box to reflect its new size by using the updated variable with "px" added to it.
