Create an HTML file with a label, an input field, and a button.

Give the input field an id attribute of "bill" so that we can easily reference it in our JavaScript code.

Add an onclick attribute to the button that calls a JavaScript function called calculate.

In the JavaScript code, define the calculate function that retrieves the value of the input field with an id of bill.

Convert the input value to a float using parseFloat.

Check if the input value is not a number using the isNaN() function. If it's not a number, log an error message to the console 
and return from the function.

If the input value is valid, calculate the tip amount by multiplying the bill by 0.15 and store it in a variable called tipAmount.

Calculate the total amount by adding the bill and the tip amount, and store it in a variable called totalAmount.

Use string interpolation to log the message "Tip: $X. Total: $X" to the console, where X is the value of tipAmount and totalAmount rounded to 2 decimal places using the .toFixed(2) method.

Test the code by opening the HTML file in a web browser, entering a bill amount into the input field, and clicking the button to see the tip and total amounts logged to the console.
