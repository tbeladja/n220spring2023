To create an array with 3 "best times" (numbers), write the array so the times are in order from lowest to highest, and then display the second and third place times in two different divs, you would first create an array of numbers and then use the sort() method to sort the array in ascending order. You would then display the second place time in one div and the third place time in another div using the array's index notation.
