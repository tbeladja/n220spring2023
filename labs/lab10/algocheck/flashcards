Create a new HTML document.
Inside the body tag, create a div element to display the answer to the question when a button is clicked.
Create 3 button elements, each with a data-answer attribute that lists the answer to the question asked by the button.
Write an event listener function that gets the value of the data-answer attribute of the button that was clicked and displays it in the div element created in step 2.
Add the event listener to each button using the addEventListener() method with a click event. Use the same event listener function for all buttons.
Write the questions that each button will ask and include them in the button elements as text content.
