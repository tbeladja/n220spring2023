Create a new HTML document.
Inside the body tag, create a div element with a class of "row".
Inside the "row" div, create three div elements with a class of "square". Give each of them a width and height of 200px and a margin of 5px. Float them left so they appear in a row.
Add a data attribute to each square div to store the color it should change to when clicked (e.g. data-color="red").
Write an event listener function that changes the background color of the clicked element to the color stored in its data attribute.
Add the event listener to each square div using the addEventListener() method with a click event. Use the same event listener function for all three divs.
