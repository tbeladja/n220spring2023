First, I'll create an object to store all the information about the ball. This object will have properties such as x and y position, size, color, velocity, etc.

Next, I'll set the initial values for each of these properties. For example, I might set the ball's starting position to the center of the canvas, set its size to 20 pixels, set its color to red, and set its velocity to a value such as (5, 5).

In my update function, I'll use the values stored in the ball object to update its position. I'll do this by adding the velocity to the x and y position. This will move the ball in each frame of the animation.

To make the ball bounce, I'll check if it has hit a wall. If it has, I'll change its velocity to be in the opposite direction. For example, if it hits the top wall, I'll change its y velocity to be negative.

I'll repeat steps 3 and 4 in each frame of the animation, using the updated values stored in the ball object to determine its new position and velocity.
