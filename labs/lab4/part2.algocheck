Create two objects for the tall rectangles
Give each object properties for x, y, width, and height
Set the x properties of the objects so that one rectangle appears on the left side of the screen and the other on the right side.
In the draw function, draw both rectangles to the screen based on their properties.
Check if the up arrow key is pressed.
If the up arrow key is pressed, make the first rectangle move up and the second rectangle move down.
Check if the down arrow key is pressed.
If the down arrow key is pressed, make the first rectangle move down and the second rectangle move up.
