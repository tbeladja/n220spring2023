Create a function: Begin by creating a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns true if a win is found, and false if a win is not found. You can name this function "checkForWinner".

Loop through the array: Within the checkForWinner function, use a loop to iterate through the array and check for the win condition. Depending on the game, this condition may differ, but in general, you should be checking for a specific sequence of numbers (such as three in a row or four in a column).

Return true or false: Once the loop has completed, return true if the win condition was met and false if it was not.

Integrate the function: With the checkForWinner function complete, you can now modify the rest of your application to employ it. Depending on the structure of your code, you may need to make some adjustments to integrate the function properly.

Call the function: Wherever you were previously checking for a win condition, replace that code with a call to the checkForWinner function. Pass in the relevant array of numbers as an argument and store the returned value in a variable.

Update the UI: Finally, use the value stored in the variable to update the UI to reflect whether a win has occurred or not. This may involve displaying a message to the user, changing the color of certain elements on the page, or triggering some other action.
