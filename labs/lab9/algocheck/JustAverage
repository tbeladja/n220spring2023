Begin by creating a new project in your preferred programming language.
Create a user interface that allows the user to enter a list of comma-separated numbers.
When the user clicks the "submit" button, the program should read the input and split it into an array of numbers using the comma as the separator.
The program should then convert the string versions of the numbers into actual number versions using a built-in function or a custom function.
Next, the program should loop through the array and sum up the values.
After summing up the values, the program should calculate the average of the array by dividing the sum by the length of the array.
Finally, the program should display the average and the sum to the user, and remove the text from the input so the user can enter new numbers.
