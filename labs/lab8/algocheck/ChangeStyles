Create three div elements that are styled to be square and red using CSS. Assign each div a unique ID to reference it later in your JavaScript code.

Create a function called "changeStyle" that takes an HTMLElement as an input.

In the "changeStyle" function, modify the CSS of the input HTMLElement to have a blue background color and a smaller width than height.

Create three button elements with an onclick event listener that calls a function when clicked.

Write a function for each button that uses the ID of the corresponding div to retrieve the element from the DOM.

In each of the button functions, pass the div element as an argument to the "changeStyle" function to update its style.
