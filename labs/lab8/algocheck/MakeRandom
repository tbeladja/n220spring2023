Create a button element that includes an onclick event listener that calls a function when clicked.

Add a div element that has an ID. This element will be used to display the randomly generated number.

In your JavaScript code, write a function that generates a random whole number between 0 and 10 using the Math.random() and Math.floor() methods.

Write a second function that handles the onclick event when the button is clicked.

In the onclick event handler function, call the function that generates the random number.

Use the ID of the div element to update its text content with the randomly generated number.
