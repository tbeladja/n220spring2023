Create a form element that includes an input field and a button. Assign an ID to the input field to reference it later in your JavaScript code.

Add a div element that also has an ID. You will use this element to display the result of the calculation.

In your JavaScript code, create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns true if it is divisible by 7 and false if it is not.

In the onclick event listener for the button, use the ID of the input field to retrieve the number entered by the user.

Pass the number to the divisible function you created earlier to determine if it is divisible by 7.

Use conditional statements to update the text content of the div element based on whether the number is divisible by 7 or not.
